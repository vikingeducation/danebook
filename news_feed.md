# Display Newsfeed

  As a user on the site,
  I want to see the activity of my friends
  Because I'm all alone on a saturday night...

- Redirect signed-in users automatically to their newsfeed instead of the home page
- Display a chronological listing of posts from the current user's friends
- Allow liking/commenting on all these posts
- Allow posting directly atop the newsfeed (like in the timeline)
- You can only view your own newsfeed


# Recently Active Friends

  As a user on the Newsfeed,
  I want to see which of my friends have recently been active
  So I know who will have good content to check out

- Newsfeed displays a recently-active list of friends on the left pane


# Newsfeed Photos and Posts (Optional)

  As a user on the newsfeed page
  I want to see both the photos and posts of my friends
  To get an integrated look at their lives

- Photos AND posts show up in the newsfeed in chronological order from the users' friends
- Pagination...?
- Photos are styled similar to Posts
