##Notes

###Setting up the comment and like tables
Comments and likes have a polymorphic relationship with the Photo, Post, and Comment(self association for comment) tables.  Each comment and like will belong to a user.  When a user is destroyed, the associated comments and likes will be destroyed.

###Architecting the friendships
A self association was used to connect a user with another user. A separate table, the friendings table, holds the connection between users and maintains uniqueness so that multiple friendships cannot be sent for the same relationship.

###Paperclip and S3 photo storage

Paperclip in conjunction with S3 is utilized to manage the photo upload.  Each photo is saved in 4 different forms, thumb size, medium size, large size, and the original.

###AJAX
JS erb and jQuery handle most of the AJAX updates. PostgreSQL is the single source of truth for all data. The front-end calls for updates and manages page updates using promises.
