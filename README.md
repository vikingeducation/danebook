What is it?
-----------

A facebook clone built solo as part of learning Ruby on Rails from [Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/).
After learning about a specific topic, we implement it in this app as practice.
Basically, it's a "demo" app which serves as kind of a reference manual for various syntactical implementation details.
Not perfect, but served as great playground to practice coding.
