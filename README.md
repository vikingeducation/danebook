# Tour of the App

Though you can [go here](https://lortzadanebook.herokuapp.com/) to sign up and see a working version of this app (delayed spin-up courtesy of free heroku dynos ;) ), here is an overview of the features. Starting with...

A timeline page for Clark "Mouth" Devereaux from the 80s classic movie _The Goonies_! And here he is having a not-so-friendly comment thread about the Truffle Shuffle. Jeeze you guys, it's been _decades_. Anyway, you get the drill. This app looks and acts like Facebook.

It's got pages where you can update your profile info:

## App Architecture
Now that we've got the basic functionality out of the way, let's get down to the interesting parts of the code that make this happen.

This app's architecture is a little complicated, with self-referencing `User`s table associations and some polymorphism with `Like`s and `Comment`s, and some user authorization rules.

### Self-Referencing Users for Friending
A self-referencing model can be a little confusing, since the association is taking the place of 2 fully-independent classes... which happen to be the same class. Fortunately, Rails will let you name things whatever you want. And I think that's the secret sauce right there: the naming.

In my app, a `friending` does not need to be confirmed, so all friends count regardles of who initiates with whom. That said, for clarity of roles my `User` model has `initiated` and `received` friendings:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

class User < ApplicationRecord
...

  # Friendings initiator
  has_many :initiated_friendings,
           :class_name => "Friending",
           :foreign_key => :initiator_id
  has_many :friended_users,
           :through => :initiated_friendings,
           :source => :friend_recipient

  # Friendings recipient
  has_many :received_friendings,
           :class_name => "Friending",
           :foreign_key => :recipient_id
  has_many :users_friended_by,
           :through => :received_friendings,
           :source => :friend_initiator
  ...
```

And these correspond with the `Friending`s table associations:

```ruby
# app/models/friending.rb

class Friending < ApplicationRecord

  # The Initiator side
  belongs_to :friend_initiator,
             :foreign_key => :initiator_id,
             :class_name => "User"

  # The Recipient side
  belongs_to :friend_recipient,
             :foreign_key => :recipient_id,
             :class_name => "User"
  ...
```

 Since a friend can be either one you initiate or receive, we'd can't call just `received_friendings` or just `initiated_friendings` to see all of a user's friends. That means we need to fake a "friends" association on the `User` model.

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

class User < ApplicationRecord
...

  def friends
    (friended_users + users_friended_by).uniq
  end
```

Though honestly, in order to wrangle in those nasty N+1 queries, the method I actually used looks like this:

```ruby
def friends
  (friended_users.includes(:profile_pic, :received_friendings, :initiated_friendings, :friended_users, :users_friended_by) + users_friended_by.includes(:profile_pic, :received_friendings, :initiated_friendings, :friended_users, :users_friended_by)).uniq
end
```

And it requires a little more fancy footwork in the controller to "unfriend" someone, but no one ever said friendships were easy:

```ruby
# app controllers/friendings_controller.rb

class FriendingsController < ApplicationController
...

  def destroy
  ...
    unfriended_user = User.find(params[:id])

    if current_user.friended_users.include?(unfriended_user)
      current_user.friended_users.delete(unfriended_user)
    elsif current_user.users_friended_by.include?(unfriended_user)
      current_user.users_friended_by.delete(unfriended_user)
    else
      ...
  end
```

### Polymorphic Associations
I wrote a more extensive [blog post about this](http://lortza.github.io/2018/01/30/polymorphic-likes.html), so I'll keep this explanation short and limit it to just "likes". In a nutshell, in order to be able to "like" a text `post`, `photo` post, or `comment`, I needed to implement some polymorphic relationships -- and that happened via a `likes` table which tracks the liked object's class and id.

```ruby
# db/schema.rb
...

create_table "likes", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.integer  "user_id"
    t.string   "likeable_type"
    t.integer  "likeable_id"
    ...
  end
```

The associations between the `User` (the object doing the liking) and the objects being liked is called `:likeable` and it looks like this:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
...
has_many :photos_they_like, through: :likes,
         source: :likeable, source_type: :Photo

# app/models/photo.rb
has_many :likes, as: :likeable
```

But since liking can happen to _3_ different classes, it made sense to pull the redundant code out into a concern called `Liking` and then just include that in the models that are likeable:

```ruby
# app/models/concerns/liking.rb

module Liking
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    has_many :likes, as: :likeable
  end
end


# app/models/photo.rb
class Photo < ApplicationRecord
...
  include Liking
...

# app/models/post.rb
class Post < ApplicationRecord
...
  include Liking
...

# app/models/comment.rb
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
...
  include Liking
...
```

From the views, the "Like"/"Unlike" links pass the information to the `likes_controller` via the polymorphic url helper:

```ruby
link_to 'Like', polymorphic_url([current_user, object, :likes], likeable: klass), remote: true, method: :post
```

which is then parsed by the `likes_controller` in a smidge of metaprogramming by pulling the value from the `:likeable` param and then eventually storing that in the `likes` table:

```ruby
klass_name = params[:likeable]

parent_key = params.keys.select{|key| key.match(klass_name.downcase + '_id')}.first
```

As I was building these relationships, I was focused on keeping this as clean, non-klugey, and rails-typical as possible. #nosurprises #itscomplicated

### User Authorization
Since there are a lot of little decisions to be made about who gets to do what to what, I implemented user authorization with the help of `gem 'pundit'`. This keeps all of my policies organized and logical in one tidy spot:

```
/app
  /policies
    - application_policy.rb
    - comment_policy.rb
    - photo_policy.rb
    - post_policy.rb
    - user_policy.rb
```

For example, users are not permitted to write posts on another user's timeline, nor are they allowed to delete or edit another user's post. The post policy makes these rules very clear:

```ruby
# app/policies/post_policy.rb

class PostPolicy < ApplicationPolicy

  # Allow these actions only if...

  def create?
    record.user_id == user.id
  end

  def destroy?
    record.user_id == user.id
  end

  def edit?
    record.user_id == user.id
  end
end
```

Writing the policy is half of the task. The other half is invoking it. Since the policies are conveniently named to match controller actions, the gem knows which policy to invoke when referenced in a controller:

```ruby
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb

class PostsController < ApplicationController
...

  def create
  ...
    post = current_user.posts.new(post_params)

    # checks if post.user_id == user.id
    authorize post

    if post.save
    ...
```

These policies are great gate keepers too. For example, if a user isn't allowed to create a new post on another user's timeline, it's best we don't even show them the form:

```erb
<!-- app/views/timelines/show -->
...

<% if policy(@timeline.post).create? %>
  <%= render 'shared/activity_form', user: @timeline.user, post: @timeline.post, photo: @timeline.photo %>
<% end %>
```

### App Architecture Evaluation
The current codebase has a RubyCritic score of 93.84, which is nice while still has plenty of room for improvement.

![Alt text](/app/assets/images/screenshots/rubycritic.png?raw=true "RubyCritic stats")

According to the dots, my Rails app is made of to groups of files 1) the ones in the bottom left that are low in complexity and churn rate, and 2) the ones in the top center that are moderately complex and churn a moderate amount. It's [that second group](https://github.com/chad/turbulence#hopefully-meaningful-metrics), that I'll need to focus on first for refactoring.

The files in the second group, floating around up there in the high complexity region, are the controllers for the various activities that users do: posts, photo posts, comments, and likes. Some of that complexity comes from determining a parent class or object (in the case of likes and comments), some of it comes from features like sending a mailing or redirecting back to the page where the request was initiated.

For the logic that determines parents, I'm thinking about a model that may be able to handle these kinds of processes. As for the redirects, incorporating an AJAX call to handle the create/destroy actions for `like`s and `comment`s will take away the need for the redirect logic. And that's convenient, because that's on my to-do list for features.

The green dot on the far right is the `User` model. Given that users have their hands in every interaction and a good deal of those involve that self-referencing logic, I know the churn is going to stay high on this file. I'm thinking my best bet is to reduce the complexity of the file. At the moment, I don't have any great ideas on how to do that and I'd love to hear suggestions.
