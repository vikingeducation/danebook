Tests, TDD, Friend Search, Mailer(s), Newsfeed (?), Refactoring

Hundredletter words are split to new line at edge of their container
  (BONUS: retain clickability if hyperlink)
Prettify About view
Use Presenter(s), use Helper(s), refactor generally
Spiff up README file

"Remember me" remembers across sessions; w/out, it doesn't (how to test for this??)
